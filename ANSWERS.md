- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

--because you can't use lifecycle methods with functional components

- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

1. componentDidMount -- fetches data from api call after initial render or for declaring event listeners
2. componentDidUpdate -- tracks changes in state and updates data
3. componentWillUnmount -- clears everything you declared in componentDidMount

- [x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

--abstract reusable logic and keep code DRY and clean

- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?

--to allow us to think more about our code and the possible problems it might encounter and act on it as early as we can
